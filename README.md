# Onycholytics App

Onycholytics is a disease-tracking applicaion for mobile and tablet devices that help patients track their nailsâ€™ conditions during the curing process. Patients may take photos on their toes and edit afterwords to do standardization, then put it in the gallary to do comparison. Besides different patients are able to communicate with this app to know more about their stages of disease.

## Setting up AppGyver Steroids

We used the AngularJS and AppGyver Steroids frameworks to build this mobile app. Here are some steps required to get everything set up:

1. [Create an account for AppGyver](http://www.appgyver.com/steroids_sign_up)
2. [Set up developing tools](https://academy.appgyver.com/installwizard/steps#/home) for a guide)

## Downloading Source Code and Dependencies

1. Clone the code package and place it in your desired directory
2. Open the Command Line (Windows) or Terminal (OSX) in the Onycholytics root directory and run:

```
steroids update
```

## Developing the App

To test the code, open the Command Line (Windows) or Terminal (OSX) in the FeldcoLoanRequest root directory and run:
```
steroids connect
```
A web page will open containing a QR code that you may scan using the [AppGyver Scanner app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.appgyver.freshandroid&hl=en) on your tablet. You may also open an emulator. Instructions for setting up the GenyMotion Android Emulator can be found [here.](http://docs.appgyver.com/tooling/cli/emulators/genymotion/)

At the top of the file there should be a short introduction and/ or overview that explains what the project is. This description should match descriptions added for package managers (Gemspec, package.json, etc.)

##SYSTEM REQUIRMENTS
- [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) - HTML enhanced for web apps!
- [Supersonic](http://www.appgyver.com/supersonic/ui) - Build beautiful data-driven apps with real native performance
- [Parse](https://parse.com/) - dynamic web app hosting and database

##Code Example

Show what the library does as concisely as possible, developers should be able to figure out how your project solves their problem by looking at the code example. Make sure the API you are showing off is obvious, and that your code is short and concise.

##Motivation

A short description of the motivation behind the creation and maintenance of the project. This should explain why the project exists.

#API Reference

Depending on the size of the project, if it is small and simple enough the reference docs can be added to the README. For medium size to larger projects it is important to at least provide a link to where the API reference docs live.

#Tests

Describe and show how to run the tests with code examples.

#Contributors

Let people know how they can dive into the project, include important links to things like issue trackers, irc, twitter accounts if applicable.

#License

A short snippet describing the license (MIT, Apache, etc.)
